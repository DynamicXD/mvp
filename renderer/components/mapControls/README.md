# Map Controls Manager

## Overview
The Map Controls Manager is a comprehensive solution that fixes map control issues in Sky Loom. It provides a robust, centralized system for managing all map-related functionality including drawing tools, navigation controls, layer management, and fullscreen mode.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Map Controls Not Working**
- **Problem**: Map control buttons were not responding to clicks
- **Solution**: Implemented proper event listener initialization with error handling and fallbacks
- **Root Cause**: Event listeners were being set up before DOM elements were ready

### 2. **Drawing Tools Not Initializing**
- **Problem**: Drawing tools were not properly connected to the Cesium viewer
- **Solution**: Added proper initialization sequence with viewer availability checks
- **Root Cause**: Timing issues between Cesium viewer initialization and drawing tools setup

### 3. **Layer Switching Issues**
- **Problem**: Layer toggle button was not working consistently
- **Solution**: Implemented robust layer management with proper error handling
- **Root Cause**: Missing error handling for Cesium Ion API calls

### 4. **Fullscreen Mode Problems**
- **Problem**: Fullscreen button was not updating state properly
- **Solution**: Added proper fullscreen state management and UI updates
- **Root Cause**: Missing event listeners for fullscreen state changes

### 5. **Keyboard Shortcuts Not Working**
- **Problem**: Keyboard shortcuts were not implemented
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive keyboard shortcut support
- **Root Cause**: No keyboard event handling was implemented

## Features

### Core Functionality
- ✅ **Home Button**: Returns to drone location or default view
- ✅ **Layer Toggle**: Switches between satellite, roads, and terrain views
- ✅ **Measure Tool**: Placeholder for distance measurement functionality
- ✅ **Fullscreen Mode**: Toggle fullscreen with proper state management
- ✅ **Drawing Tools**: Polygon, square, circle, and erase tools
- ✅ **Clear All**: Remove all drawn shapes

### Advanced Features
- ✅ **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Ctrl+H (Home), Ctrl+L (Layers), Ctrl+M (Measure), Ctrl+F (Fullscreen)
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user notifications
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Works on different screen sizes
- ✅ **Accessibility**: High contrast and reduced motion support
- ✅ **State Management**: Proper tracking of active tools and states

### Technical Improvements
- ✅ **Initialization Sequence**: Proper async initialization with viewer availability checks
- ✅ **Event Management**: Centralized event handling with cleanup
- ✅ **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry mechanisms for failed operations
- ✅ **Performance**: Optimized rendering and event handling
- ✅ **Debugging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

## Usage

### Basic Controls
```javascript
// Access the map controls manager
const mapControls = window.mapControlsManager;

// Check if ready
if (mapControls.isReady()) {
    // Use controls
    mapControls.goHome();
    mapControls.toggleLayers();
}
```

### Drawing Tools
```javascript
// Select a drawing tool
mapControls.selectDrawingTool('polygon');
mapControls.selectDrawingTool('square');
mapControls.selectDrawingTool('circle');

// Cancel current tool
mapControls.cancelCurrentTool();

// Clear all shapes
mapControls.clearAll();
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Ctrl + H`: Go home
- `Ctrl + L`: Toggle layers
- `Ctrl + M`: Toggle measure tool
- `Ctrl + F`: Toggle fullscreen
- `Escape`: Cancel current tool

## File Structure

```
renderer/components/mapControls/
├── mapControlsManager.js    # Main manager class
├── mapControls.css          # Styling for controls
└── README.md               # This documentation
```

## Integration

The Map Controls Manager integrates with the existing Sky Loom architecture:

1. **HTML Integration**: Automatically loads with the main application
2. **CSS Integration**: Provides enhanced styling for map controls
3. **JavaScript Integration**: Replaces the old `setupMapControls()` function
4. **Cesium Integration**: Properly connects to the Cesium viewer
5. **Drawing Tools Integration**: Works with existing drawing tools

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Controls not appearing**
   - Check if Cesium viewer is loaded
   - Verify CSS is properly loaded
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Drawing tools not working**
   - Ensure Cesium viewer is initialized
   - Check if DrawingTools class is available
   - Verify event listeners are attached

3. **Layer switching not working**
   - Check Cesium Ion token validity
   - Verify internet connection
   - Check browser console for API errors

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting:
```javascript
window.mapControlsManager.debug = true;
```

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] **Measure Tool**: Implement actual distance measurement
- [ ] **Custom Layers**: Support for custom map layers
- [ ] **Tool Presets**: Save and load drawing tool configurations
- [ ] **Undo/Redo**: History management for drawing operations
- [ ] **Export/Import**: Save and load drawn shapes

## Contributing

When making changes to the map controls:

1. Test all functionality thoroughly
2. Ensure error handling is in place
3. Update this documentation
4. Test on different screen sizes
5. Verify accessibility features still work
